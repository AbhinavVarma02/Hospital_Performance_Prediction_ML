# About code files
üìÅ File: 602_Regression_Model_Abhinav&Devika.ipynb

- Performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing
- Handled missing values and selected relevant features
- Applied multiple regression models to predict hospital readmission scores
- Prepared cleaned dataset for use in classification and clustering tasks

üìÅ File: 602_Clustering_&_Classification_Model_Abhinav&Devika.ipynb

- Used cleaned dataset prepared in the regression notebook
- Performed clustering analysis to explore hospital groupings
- Conducted classification with outliers removed
- Also compared model performance using original dataset (with outliers)
- Enables comparison of robustness and accuracy across data conditions


üìÅ File: 602_Classification_Model_Abhinav&Devika.ipynb

- Conducted classification modeling using the original dataset with outliers
- Applied various classification algorithms and evaluated their performance
- Helps benchmark models trained on full, unfiltered data
